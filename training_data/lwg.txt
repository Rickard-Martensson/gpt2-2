kommentar: b212: I had an idea today :laughing:Do custom graphics even work? I know they do for units and buildings, but I think I've never saw anything with custom textures.
kommentar: Rynus: wdym?you about player's own custom textures or somethinghttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377132991647973387/712694646530244668/aztec_previewx2v2.pnglike it
kommentar: Aicy: I think those are all default texturesonly the buildings and units are customs
kommentar: b212: Yeah, it's pain in the ass. Would love to be able to add custom Tiles and Decoration, but AFAIK you can't.@Rynus what map is that? Looks super cool. Not sure what I'm making, just wanted to try out some old school GTA1 textures, they seem to align quite well with the style of LWG (retro/pixelarty stuff :D).
kommentar: Humon: !Custom decorations are possibleThey work as reskins of standard decosTiles also work, if you played the zombie survival game
kommentar: b212: Yeah, but I'm limited to current number of decorations, right?I'm actually reskinning right now. But might need way more tiles :/you can take a look, LWG GTA, just published it for fun, still not much going on, but wanted to see if texturing works and it seems to be working just fine
kommentar: Humon: !Just fine is a stretchTiles are loaded before custom textures, so you must open the game twice in a single session before they work
kommentar: b212: Shit, really? Just tried this with two random dudes and they seemed to see the textures right away :/ Dang.
kommentar: Humon: !It depends I guessUnpredictable
kommentar: Rynus: hmwhos mod there?
